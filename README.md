FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) is one of the simplest CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. 
In FCFS scheduling, processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue. 
When a process enters the ready queue, it is placed at the end of the queue, and the CPU scheduler selects the process at the front of the queue for execution.

The code is written in C# explaining how FCFS algorithm operates and in addition it calculates Turn around time and waiting time for each processes.
